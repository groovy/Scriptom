      <b>Scriptom</b> provides a simple yet powerful COM library for Groovy.
      It is implemented as a thin layer around  
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/">JACOB (Java COM Bridge)</a>.
      JACOB is a mature open-source library for Java that supports communicating with COM libraries
      and automation servers on Microsoft Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Scriptom</b> attempts to mirror all the functionality of JACOB, but in a "groovy" way.
      Here is a quick example that uses <code>Scripting.FileSystemObject</code> to list the paths
      to all active rooted drives on your system (italics show COM methods and properties):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        new ActiveXObject('Scripting.FileSystemObject').<i>Drives</i>.findAll{it.<i>IsReady</i>}.each{println it.<i>Path</i>}
      </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Visual Basic was never this easy!

            integer.

      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, all Variants in <b>Scriptom</b> are passed by value (not 'byref').  Note that it is
      safe to pass values 'byval' even when the method argument is marked as 'byref.'  
      In COM, 'byref' arguments allow a method to change a value which is then reflected 
      in the calling scope.  If you need to do this, take a look at the <code>VariantByref</code>
      class.  You shouldn't run into this very often with the standard COM libraries, but isn't
      it nice to know we've got your back?
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsigned integer types are also supported by <b>Scriptom</b>. Each COM unsigned type
      is converted to equivalent signed Java type.
